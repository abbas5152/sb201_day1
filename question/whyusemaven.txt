Q2. When should one use Maven?
 A2. Maven is one type of build tool.build tool is what take care of building process.
       it generates the source code,compile the source code and package the final compiled 
       file in JAR file and also installed that JAR file in central repo,org repo and local repo m2 folder.
       so in larger projects,it's very tough to keep track of what needs to be built and in what sequence and
       also what dependies require during project.So using build tool like maven will reduce the devloper work.
       and build process become more consistent
